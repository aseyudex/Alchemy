Project Description
The Emotional Budget Tracker is a web application that helps you visualize and manage your daily emotional energy. It’s for the person who feels drained after a meeting and wants to quantify exactly how much social energy they have left.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People often feel emotionally drained but lack the data to prove it. This leads to them being unable to optimize their daily social and professional interactions. The solution is to turn human emotions into quantifiable resources.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We provide a full-stack web application with a dashboard that allows users to set emotional budgets for things like "Patience," "Meeting Tolerance," and "Small-talk Energy." Users can log their emotional spending throughout the day and receive humorous alerts when their reserves are critically low.
